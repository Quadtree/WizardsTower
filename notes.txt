The game works as follows:

There are N participants. Each participant has two attributes:

Class (Public): Either Apprentice or Wizard. The wizard has a +20% chance to cast all spells
Team (Private): Either Wizard, Assassin, or Demon

Play proceeds in a random order, although once set during the first turn the order never changes.

After 50 turns, the winner is decided:

If the wizard is alive, Team Wizard wins. Dead apprentices still get credit.
If the wizard is dead and at least one assassin is alive, Team Assassin wins. Dead assasins still get credit.
If there is only one participant left, and they're a demon, they win. Dead demons never get credit.
